        From a forgotten age comes a land full of mystery and chaos. A story of an
        ancient land and characters and creatures forged in the wastelands.
        Bloody and mythical. A medieval horror tale whispered about in torch-lit
        halls and carved into massive walls of stone.
        <br /><br />
        This is a story of violence and survival. Broken kingdoms and buried
        legends. All beings in this story carry the weight of battle, betrayal,
        and dark energy. One single mutated human shapes the fate of this world.
